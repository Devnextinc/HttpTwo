# HttpTwo

A basic C# HTTP/2 client library implementation

The focus of this library is to bring enough HTTP/2 functionality to .NET for implementing the APNS (Apple Push Notification Service) provider API over HTTP/2 within [PushSharp](https://github.com/redth/pushsharp)

It's currently very untested and partially implemented.
